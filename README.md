ThunderGrowl
============

Updated Growl Extension for Thunderbird - This extension was forked from the work of brian dunnington part of the growl for windows addons site.

I found it much in need of a few enhancements and work on it seemed to have stopped so I'm taking the jump to try and contribute. The main goals of this project are as follows:

+  Ensure the extension remains compatible with Thunderbird releases
+  Prevent growling messages classified as Junk
+  Allow message filters to run before growling
+  Allow some level of folder/sender/subject filtering
+  Allow some customization of the Growl that is sent.


Please feel free to contribute ideas and patches. Not being anything close to a XPCOM hacker what is possible to implement may be limited.

If you just want the current packaged extension just take the latest thundergrowl.xpi file in the build folder.
